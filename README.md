# DevTask Manager

**DevTask Manager** is a lightweight, browser-based task management web app built with pure **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript**.  
It allows developers and individuals to efficiently organize, categorize, and track tasks in a Kanban-style interface — without any frameworks or backend dependencies.

## 🚀 Features

- 🗂️ **Kanban Board Layout** — Tasks are organized into **To Do**, **In Progress**, and **Done** columns.  
- 📝 **Add, Edit, and Manage Tasks** — Create detailed tasks with title, description, category, priority, and due date.  
- 🎨 **Modern Glassmorphic UI** — Clean design with dark/light theme toggle.  
- 🔍 **Search & Filter** — Filter tasks by category or priority and search by keyword.  
- 💾 **LocalStorage Support** *(if implemented in `script.js`)* — Keeps your tasks saved even after page reloads.  
- ⚡ **No Frameworks Needed** — Runs entirely in the browser using plain HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
